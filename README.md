# Cpp-Game
This is a second year project for the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) course: programming with C++.

The task was to use a custom game engine made by the staff which you can find here: https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg and create a game. You must import the library of the game engine to your project (preferably in Visual Studio). Be sure to follow the instructions on how to use the library here: in order to understand how the game works

We created a fighting arcade game called fighter x. We used assets from various sources and we changed them a bit in order to fit the style of the game better. WE DID NOT CREATE ANY OF THESE ASSETS AND WE DON'T OWN THEM.

You can find a presentation of the game in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzr07HSXRNk& Our game is at the 7:10 mark. t=162s made by Georgios Papaiwannou(the teacher of the course). Our game is at the 7:10 mark.
