# Cpp-Game
This is a second year project for the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) course: programming with C++.

The task was to use a custom game engine made by the staff which you can find here: https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg and create a game. You must import the library of the game engine to your project (preferably in Visual Studio). Be sure to follow the instructions on how to use the library in order to understand how the game works

We created a fighting arcade game called fighter x. We used assets from various sources and we changed them a bit in order to fit the style of the game better. 




**IMPORTANT:  WE DID NOT CREATE ANY OF THESE ASSETS AND WE DON'T OWN THEM. **

You can find a presentation of the game in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzr07HSXRNk& made by Georgios Papaiwannou(the teacher of the course). Our game is at the 7:10 mark.
